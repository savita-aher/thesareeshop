    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      At Naree, we believe every saree tells a story—woven not just with threads, 
      but with heritage, emotion, and artistry. Rooted in the timeless elegance of 
      Indian tradition, our silk sarees are handcrafted by skilled weavers using age-old 
      handloom techniques. From the shimmering threads of Banarasi silk to the rich 
      textures of Kanchipuram, our collection celebrates the grace and craftsmanship of 
      India’s finest textile artisans. Each piece is a tribute to tradition, designed to 
      make you feel confident, radiant, and authentically you.
